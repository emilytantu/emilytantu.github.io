### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    The lab's main goal was to reinforce knowledge of C++ programming concepts, with a particular emphasis on code style and order of operations. The ability to write well-formatted code with proper syntax and conformity to recognized coding principles was the final lesson. I was able to accurately and effectively clarify mathematical ideas in C++ as an outcome of this.

* Lab 4

    My favorite lab is the Unit Conversion lab since it reinforces modular programming and offers a real-world application of C++ fundamentals. The Hi-Lo Game Lab promotes critical thinking and branching logic through problem-solving and algorithm design. For a well-rounded learning experience, both labs include detailed testing and README instructions that are easy to understand and emphasize coding norms.

* Lab 10
    For the Olympic Judge Average lab, C++ programming skills are reinforced by developing a method to calculate a fair average of points. The Dining 2-Philosophers Schedule lab offers a distinct problem-solving exercise that improves test-taking and logic-implementation skills. Both labs emphasize following code standards and using the right formatting for organization and clarity, which adds to a thorough understanding of C++.
